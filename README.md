# How it works

 This project is a music visualizer that gets it's input put of spotify,
I made this project hands free, so the only requeriment is for music to be 
playing on the background.
 The program gets frequency inputs and uses them to set the size of shapes on the screen,
this gives the user the impression of music to output reaction I was looking for,
this with added camera movement and some nice effects gives this visualizer  a 
nice relaxing aspect.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
 
 In this assignment some of the things I'm most proud of are the fact that the visualizer
works out of spotify or any other song playing on the background of the computer and how
relaxing and in sync with the music the visualizer appears.
